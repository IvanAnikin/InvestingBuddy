# InvestingBuddy — Azure Infrastructure

## Status: Phase A Plan — Awaiting Provisioning Approval

This document is the authoritative reference for Azure staging infrastructure.
No resources have been created yet. Do not provision until the approval checklist
at the bottom of this file is completed and confirmed.

---

## Region

**Primary region: `westeurope` (Netherlands)**

- Lowest latency for EU users (platform focuses on European public companies)
- GDPR compliant — user data stays in the EU
- All required services available: App Service, PostgreSQL, Key Vault,
  Application Insights, Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o), AI Search
- `northeurope` (Ireland) reserved as future DR/secondary region

---

## Infrastructure Approach

**Bicep** — native Azure DSL, no state file, idempotent, GitHub Actions native.

Not chosen:
- CLI scripts: not idempotent, hard to review
- Terraform: over-engineered for Azure-only MVP
- Azure Developer CLI: too opinionated, less customizable

---

## Environments

| Environment | Resource Group | Branch | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Staging | `ib-stg-rg` | `main` | Planned — not provisioned |
| Production | `ib-prod-rg` | `release/*` | Future — Phase 5+ |

---

## Naming Convention

Pattern: `ib-{env}-{resource}` (lowercase, hyphens)

Exceptions:
- Storage Account: `ib{env}storage` (no hyphens — Azure limit)
- Key Vault names must be globally unique — append short random suffix if needed

---

## Authentication: OIDC (No Long-Lived Credentials)

GitHub Actions authenticates to Azure via OpenID Connect federated credentials —
no `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` JSON secret stored in GitHub.

Setup steps (manual, before provisioning):
1. Create an App Registration in Azure AD (name: `ib-github-actions-stg`)
2. Under the App Registration → Federated credentials → Add credential:
   - Organization: `IvanAnikin`
   - Repository: `InvestingBuddy`
   - Entity: `Branch`
   - Branch: `main`
   - Name: `github-actions-main`
3. Assign roles on `ib-stg-rg`:
   - `Contributor` — for resource management
   - `Key Vault Secrets Officer` — on `ib-stg-kv` specifically
4. Store these three values as GitHub Secrets (no subscription ID in repo):
   - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` (App Registration client ID)
   - `AZURE_TENANT_ID` (Azure AD tenant ID)
   - `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` (subscription — never commit to repo)

GitHub Actions login step:
```yaml
- uses: azure/login@v2
  with:
    client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
    tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
    subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
```

---

## Required GitHub Secrets

| Secret | Purpose | Created By |
|---|---|---|
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | OIDC App Registration client ID | Azure AD → App Registration |
| `AZURE_TENANT_ID` | Azure AD tenant ID | Azure AD overview page |
| `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` | Target subscription | Azure portal → Subscriptions |
| `AZURE_STAGING_DB_PASSWORD` | DB admin password (provisioning only) | Generate locally, store in KV |

Note: `AZURE_STAGING_DB_PASSWORD` is only needed during initial DB provisioning.
After that, the API reads the password from Key Vault via managed identity.

## Bicep File Structure (placeholder — not yet implemented)

```
infra/azure/
├── README.md                     # this file
├── main.bicep                    # top-level module, calls sub-modules
├── parameters/
│   └── staging.bicepparam        # staging parameter values
└── modules/
    ├── appservice.bicep          # App Service Plan + App Service
    ├── postgres.bicep            # PostgreSQL Flexible Server
    ├── storage.bicep             # Storage Account + container
    ├── keyvault.bicep            # Key Vault + RBAC assignments
    └── monitoring.bicep          # Log Analytics + Application Insights
```

## Estimated Monthly Cost (Staging, without OpenAI/Search)

| Resource | SKU | Est. USD/month |
|---|---|---|
| API App Service | B2 | ~$60 |
| Web App Service | B1 | ~$14 |
| PostgreSQL Flexible | Standard_B1ms | ~$17 |
| Storage Account | LRS, minimal use | ~$1 |
| Key Vault | Standard, minimal ops | ~$1 |
| App Insights + Log Analytics | Pay-per-use (staging) | ~$5 |
| **Subtotal** | | **~$98/month** |

When Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o) and AI Search are added in Phase 4, expect
an additional $50-250/month depending on token usage and index size.

## Azure CLI Local Setup

The Azure CLI is installed in a dedicated Python virtual environment at `~/.venvs/azure-cli`.
Do **not** use Homebrew — it does not work reliably on this Mac.
Do **not** use the project's `apps/api/.venv` — the Azure CLI must stay separate.
The `~/.venvs/azure-cli` directory is local-only and must never be committed.

### First-time install

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/azure-cli
source ~/.venvs/azure-cli/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install azure-cli

which az        # should show ~/.venvs/azure-cli/bin/az
az version
az login
az account show
```

### Standard activation (run before every Azure task)

```bash
source ~/.venvs/azure-cli/bin/activate
az version
az account show
```

Confirm the correct subscription is shown before running any `az` or Bicep command.

### What must never be committed

- `~/.venvs/` — local tooling venv
- Subscription IDs, tenant IDs, client IDs — store only in GitHub Secrets
- Azure credentials or service principal JSON
- Database passwords or generated secrets
- `.env`, `.env.staging`, `.env.production`

GitHub Actions authenticates via OIDC (not local credentials). Local `az login`
is for provisioning and inspection only — it does not affect CI/CD.

---

## Pre-Provisioning Checklist

Complete all items before running any `az` or Bicep commands:

### Local Azure CLI
- [ ] `~/.venvs/azure-cli` venv created and `azure-cli` pip-installed
- [ ] Activated: `source ~/.venvs/azure-cli/bin/activate`
- [ ] `az version` confirms CLI is working
- [ ] Logged in: `az login`
- [ ] Correct subscription confirmed: `az account show`
- [ ] Subscription ID noted (do not commit to repo — store only in GitHub Secrets)

### Azure AD Setup
- [ ] App Registration `ib-github-actions-stg` created
- [ ] Federated credential configured for `main` branch
- [ ] `Contributor` role assigned on `ib-stg-rg` (or subscription)
- [ ] `Key Vault Secrets Officer` role will be assigned on KV after creation

### GitHub Secrets
- [ ] `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` set in GitHub repository secrets
- [ ] `AZURE_TENANT_ID` set in GitHub repository secrets
- [ ] `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` set in GitHub repository secrets
- [ ] `AZURE_STAGING_DB_PASSWORD` generated and set (use: `openssl rand -hex 16`)

### Plan Review
- [ ] Resource naming approved: `ib-stg-*`
- [ ] Region confirmed: `westeurope`
- [ ] Infrastructure approach confirmed: Bicep
- [ ] SKUs reviewed and cost (~$98/month) accepted
- [ ] OIDC approach confirmed (no long-lived credential JSON)

## Next Step: Provisioning Prompt

After all checklist items above are complete, provide:
1. Your Azure Subscription ID (will be stored only in GitHub Secrets, not in any committed file)
2. Confirmation that `az account show` shows the correct subscription
3. Confirmation that checklist items above are done

Then run this prompt:

```
Orchestrator: Execute Infrastructure Phase A provisioning.
Environment: staging
Region: westeurope
Resource group: ib-stg-rg
Approach: Bicep
az login has been run — az account show confirms the correct subscription.
All checklist items in infra/azure/README.md are complete.

Proceed to:
1. Write all Bicep module files under infra/azure/
2. Provision the resource group and core resources (no OpenAI, no AI Search)
3. Configure managed identity access on Key Vault and Storage
4. Add GitHub Actions deployment workflows
```
