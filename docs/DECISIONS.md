## ADR-001: Python FastAPI as Backend Framework

**Date:** 2026-06-16
**Status:** Accepted

### Context
The platform needs a backend framework that integrates well with LangGraph, LangChain, SQLAlchemy and the Python data science ecosystem. The primary alternative was Node.js.

### Decision
Use Python FastAPI with SQLAlchemy async, Alembic and Pydantic v2.

### Consequences
- Best ecosystem compatibility with LangChain, LangGraph, OpenBB and financial data tooling.
- Strong typing via Pydantic.
- Async support for LLM streaming.
- Team must maintain two languages (Python backend, TypeScript frontend).

## ADR-002: LangGraph for Agent Orchestration

**Date:** 2026-06-16
**Status:** Accepted

### Context
The platform requires stateful, multi-step agent workflows with branching, retry logic, human-in-the-loop review and durable execution. Simple single-prompt LLM calls are not sufficient for the council-of-agents architecture.

### Decision
Use LangGraph for all agent workflows. LangChain for tool wrappers, document loaders and retrievers.

### Consequences
- Explicit graph-based workflow state is auditable and debuggable.
- Supports branching and conditional flows (e.g., request more research if quality is low).
- LangGraph is a production-grade framework maintained by LangChain Inc.
- Adds a learning curve for developers unfamiliar with graph-based workflow design.

## ADR-003: Azure as Primary Cloud Platform

**Date:** 2026-06-16
**Status:** Accepted

### Context
The platform requires LLM runtime, vector search, blob storage, PostgreSQL and background job infrastructure. Microsoft Azure was selected over AWS and GCP.

### Decision
Use Microsoft Azure as the primary cloud platform, specifically:
- Azure OpenAI (LLM runtime)
- Azure AI Search (vector search / RAG)
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Application Insights
- Azure App Service (hosting)

### Consequences
- Azure OpenAI provides enterprise-grade compliance and data residency.
- Integrated managed identity reduces secrets management burden.
- Azure AI Search is well-suited for hybrid search (keyword + vector).
- Vendor lock-in to Azure for LLM runtime (mitigated by LangChain abstraction layer).

## ADR-004: Clerk for MVP Authentication

**Date:** 2026-06-16
**Status:** Accepted

### Context
The platform needs user authentication for V2 (personalized recommendations). Evaluating Clerk vs. Auth0 vs. Microsoft Entra External ID.

### Decision
Use Clerk for MVP authentication due to fastest implementation time and clean Next.js integration.

### Consequences
- Fastest time to working auth in Next.js.
- Good user management dashboard.
- Upgrade path to Microsoft Entra External ID available if deeper Azure integration is needed.
- Adds a paid dependency (Clerk pricing scales with users).

## ADR-005: No Automatic Trade Execution

**Date:** 2026-06-16
**Status:** Accepted

### Context
The platform could theoretically connect to broker APIs and execute trades automatically based on agent recommendations.

### Decision
The platform will never automatically execute trades. It provides research and decision support only. Users make their own investment decisions and execute trades through their own brokers.

### Consequences
- Avoids MiFID II regulated investment advice classification.
- Reduces regulatory complexity significantly.
- Aligns with the product principle of human-in-the-loop decision making.
- Platform cannot monetize through execution fees.

## ADR-006: Judge System Does Not Auto-Deploy Prompt Changes

**Date:** 2026-06-16
**Status:** Accepted

### Context
The Judge system evaluates agent output quality and recommends prompt and workflow improvements. A fully automated system could apply these improvements directly to production.

### Decision
All Judge improvement suggestions must be reviewed and explicitly approved by an admin before being applied to production prompts or workflows.

### Consequences
- Prevents automated drift of investment analysis quality without human oversight.
- Supports auditability — every prompt change has a human approval record.
- Slows the improvement cycle compared to fully automated self-improvement.
- Consistent with the human-in-the-loop principle throughout the platform.
